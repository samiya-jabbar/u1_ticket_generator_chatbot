[12/29/2021 1:57:06 PM] Samiya Jabbar: the task you have mentioned can be done by me.

[12/29/2021 2:39:42 PM] Samiya Jabbar: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZhiRLb25utc86RJLQxMMEg

This is my channel. My few samples of previous works are uploaded on it. Please check it

[12/29/2021 9:00:17 PM] Adi I: Thanks i watched your videos. Its good work.

No there is no external or internal website.
If it will be, it will be an internal website which i will have to develop for this project, assessed using IP address link i think.
Login creation feature would be added to basic feature.
In Advanced, there will be connectivity with internal Ldap server for authentication, though i am not sure of that.
Please provide an estimate for basic and advanced senarios provided.
Let me know which other types of projects you work on.
Email your details to adinamdar1@gmail.com

[12/29/2021 9:04:27 PM] Adi I: You will not have access to the environment, as external connectivity is not there.
So i will have to replicate and develop the environment in the network.
Lets Start and then see how can we integrate at the end.
